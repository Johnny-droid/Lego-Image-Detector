## First Part

### Description

From a sample of images containing lego pieces, we want to be able to create a program that can detect:

- The number of lego pieces
- The position of each lego piece in the image
- The number of different colors

This should be done using manual image processing techniques, such as thresholding, edge detection, etc. As such, no deep learning techniques should be used.
